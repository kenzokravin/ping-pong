# ping-pong
Ping Pong game using three.js and Rust.

Rust backend logic (WebSockets + Rapier3D phys engine for validation)

First exploration into Rust.

Serves as a test for implementing WebSockets using Rust and validating physics using Rapier3D. NOTE: this is not a functioning game, the foundations are set, yet no finished playable result exists.

To run, have to clone, install ws (as this uses Node.js)

Also require 3D models (hdr and gltf), named appropriately (for use as bat and environment in three.js)
